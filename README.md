# Game Boy Experiments

Some game boy experiments in assembly GBZ80

This has been done with the help of [@ISSOtm](https://github.com/ISSOtm) tutorial on how to dev on Gameboy in ASM Z80. (You can [find it here](https://eldred.fr/gb-asm-tutorial/index.html))

## Build the project and run in BGB

You can build the project with make by typing:

``make``

``make run``

In order to be able to run the emulator, you should put bgb.exe inside:

``../../bgb/bgb64.exe``

If you made it, congratulations! You will see the ROM running smootly and flawlessly like butter on a warm toast.
